# Svelte Example

This directory is a brief example of a [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) app with serverless functions that can be deployed to ZEIT Now with zero configuration.

## How we created this example 

To get started with Svelte on Now, you can use [degit](https://github.com/Rich-Harris/degit) to initialize the project:

```shell
$ npx degit sveltejs/template my-svelte-project
```

## Deploying this Example

Once initialized, you can deploy the Svelte example with just a single command:

```shell
$ now
```
